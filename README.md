## Cellular Potts model 
This is a (Monte-Carlo) CPM implementation with Julia. Main goal is to simulate the dynamics of the biological cells in tissue-like condition (high density), and analyze the effect when different parameters are varied. These parameters are representative of single-cell properties of biological cells; self-persistence, cell-cell adhesion, and surface-tension.
